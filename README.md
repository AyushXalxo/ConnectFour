# Connect Four Game

Welcome to our Connect Four game repository. This project is a web-based version of the classic board game, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a simple AI opponent that plays against the user, making it a challenging yet fun experience.

## Features

- **Basic Game Setup**: Start with a clean 7x6 grid where two players can drop their discs.
- **Web-Based Game**: Fully implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries are required.
- **Simple AI**: Includes a basic AI opponent that randomly selects columns to place its disc.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Restart Capability**: Players can restart the game at any time using a dedicated button.

## How to Play

1. **Open the Game**: Load the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. **Play a Move**: Click on any column to drop your disc into that column.
3. **AI Moves Automatically**: After your move, the AI will make its move.
4. **Winning the Game**: The first player to align four discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
5. **Restart the Game**: Click the "Restart Game" button to start a new game at any time.

## AI Implementation

The AI implemented in this game is a basic one. It randomly selects a column that has empty spaces and places its disc there. This approach does not involve strategic planning and serves primarily to create a more interactive and engaging user experience. Future enhancements may include a more sophisticated AI using algorithms like Minimax for a challenging gameplay.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the web page and the game components.
- **CSS**: Provides styling for the game board and controls.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the game's logic and interactivity.
